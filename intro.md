Introduction
============

Census is important.

The 2020 US Census will use a new approach, Differential Privacy (DP),
to protect respondent confidentiality; this approach is based on X
years of computer science research, and affords the full disclosure of
the method. Although this approach allows a more precise accounting of
the noise introduced by the process, it also risks reducing the
utility of census data if the new approach produces counts that are
substantially noisier than the previous method. Differential Privacy
is new and unknown. And also important, (1) participation is
compulsory, including vulnerable populations, so privacy is paramount
and also required by law; (2) democratic process relies on
representation, and census is how we determine that, and also
apportionment of public funds/services; (3) perception of privacy will
reduce cost of running census. Past approach to DAS is swapping, and
is security through obscurity, generally considered bad design in
cryptography.

To date, there is a lack of empirical examination of DP in census DAS.
Code and theory is starting to emerge.[refs to census pubs, danah
boyd's whitepaper]

We quantified the error and empirical privacy loss and compare it to
the error and privacy of a more familiar sample-down algorithm.
