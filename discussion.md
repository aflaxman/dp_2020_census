Discussion
==========

TopDown introduced near minimal noise, but created a quantifiable
amount of bias.  Bias disproportionately affected small, homogeneous
districts; cities of sufficient size will not notice who they have lost, but rural districts likely *will* notice the population count (and appropriations) that they have gained.  The new DAS affords redistribution of resources from diverse urban communities to segregated rural communities.

Quality Assurance and the correct count process.

Emergency preparedness and other routine tasks.

Research tasks, e.g. segregation research and how it may be hampered.
On the other hand, human subject research requires informed consent
(Belmont Principles); de-identified data is not HSR, but if it is
re-identifiable, it should not be considered de-identified, should it?

Survey weights.

Need for continued discussion.
