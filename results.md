Error in total count varied as a function of total privacy loss
budget. We found that
$\epsilon = 0.25$ produced mean TC error of {tc_error_enum_dist_0_25}
at the enumeration district level and {tc_error_county_0_25} at the
county level;
$\epsilon = 1.0$ produced mean TC error of {tc_error_enum_dist_1_00}
at the enumeration district level and {tc_error_county_1_00} at the
county level;
and $\epsilon = 4.0$ produced mean TC error of {tc_error_enum_dist_4_00}
at the enumeration district level and {tc_error_county_4_00} at the
county level (Full table in Supplementary Appendix 1).
At the state level, there was TC error of $0.0$, as expected from the
state TC invariant. (Figure 1)
