Error in total count varied as a function of total privacy loss
budget. We found that
$\epsilon = 0.25$ produced mean TC error of {tc_error_enum_dist_0_25}
at the enumeration district level and {tc_error_county_0_25} at the
county level;
$\epsilon = 1.0$ produced mean TC error of {tc_error_enum_dist_1_00}
at the enumeration district level and {tc_error_county_1_00} at the
county level;
and $\epsilon = 4.0$ produced mean TC error of {tc_error_enum_dist_4_00}
at the enumeration district level and {tc_error_county_4_00} at the
county level (Full table in Supplementary Appendix 1).
At the state level, there was TC error of $0.0$, as expected from the
state TC invariant. (Figure 1)

Error in stratified count varied similarly.  We found that
for $\epsilon = 0.25$, the mean SC error 
at the enumeration district level was {sc_error_enum_dist_0_25} people,
at the county level was {sc_error_county_0_25} people, and
at the state level was {sc_error_state_0_25} people;
for $\epsilon = 1.0$, the mean SC error 
at the enumeration district level was {sc_error_enum_dist_1_00} people,
at the county level was {sc_error_county_1_00} people, and
at the state level was {sc_error_state_1_00} people; and
for $\epsilon = 4.00$, the mean SC error 
at the enumeration district level was {sc_error_enum_dist_4_00} people,
at the county level was {sc_error_county_4_00} people, and
at the state level was {sc_error_state_4_00} people.

We found that
for $\epsilon = 0.25$, the TC empirical privacy loss
at the enumeration district level was {tc_privacy_loss_enum_dist_0_25},
at the county level was {tc_privacy_loss_county_0_25}, and
at the state level was {tc_privacy_loss_state_0_25};
for $\epsilon = 1.0$, the TC empirical privacy loss
at the enumeration district level was {tc_privacy_loss_enum_dist_1_00},
at the county level was {tc_privacy_loss_county_1_00}, and
at the state level was {tc_privacy_loss_state_1_00}; and
for $\epsilon = 4.0$, the TC empirical privacy loss
at the enumeration district level was {tc_privacy_loss_enum_dist_4_00},
at the county level was {tc_privacy_loss_county_4_00}, and
at the state level was {tc_privacy_loss_state_4_00}.



We found that
for $\epsilon = 0.25$, the SC empirical privacy loss
at the enumeration district level was {sc_privacy_loss_enum_dist_0_25},
at the county level was {sc_privacy_loss_county_0_25}, and
at the state level was {sc_privacy_loss_state_0_25};
for $\epsilon = 1.0$, the SC empirical privacy loss
at the enumeration district level was {sc_privacy_loss_enum_dist_1_00},
at the county level was {sc_privacy_loss_county_1_00}, and
at the state level was {sc_privacy_loss_state_1_00}; and
for $\epsilon = 4.0$, the SC empirical privacy loss
at the enumeration district level was {sc_privacy_loss_enum_dist_4_00},
at the county level was {sc_privacy_loss_county_4_00}, and
at the state level was {sc_privacy_loss_state_4_00}.
